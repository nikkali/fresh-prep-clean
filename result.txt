I'll guide you through deploying to Netlify step by step:

1. First, create a GitHub repository:
- Go to GitHub.com
- Click "New repository"
- Name it (e.g., "fresh-prep")
- Keep it public
- Don't initialize with any files

2. Prepare your local project:
```bash
# In your project directory
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

3. Deploy to Netlify:
- Go to netlify.com
- Sign up/Login
- Click "Add new site"
- Choose "Import an existing project"
- Select "Deploy with GitHub"
- Select your repository
- Configure build settings:
  ```
  Build command: npm run build
  Publish directory: .next
  ```
- Click "Deploy site"

4. Important files to check before deploying:

=== Start File ===
netlify.toml
---
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"

[build.environment]
  NEXT_USE_NETLIFY_EDGE = "true"
  NODE_VERSION = "18"
=== End File ===

=== Start File ===
next.config.js
---
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',
  images: {
    unoptimized: true,
    domains: ['images.pexels.com', 'images.unsplash.com'],
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
=== End File ===

=== Start File ===
package.json
---
{

  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,

5. Step by step deployment:

```bash
# 1. Install Netlify CLI (optional but helpful)
npm install -g netlify-cli

# 2. Login to Netlify (if you installed the CLI)
netlify login

# 3. Initialize Netlify (if using CLI)
netlify init

# 4. Install dependencies
npm install

# 5. Build locally to test
npm run build

# 6. Deploy
git push origin main  # Netlify will auto-deploy
# OR
netlify deploy --prod  # If using CLI
```

6. After deployment:

- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Click on your site
- Go to "Site settings" > "Identity"
- Enable Identity
- Enable Git Gateway
- Set registration to "Invite only"
- Invite yourself as an admin

7. Configure your domain (optional):
- Go to "Domain settings"
- Add your custom domain
- Follow DNS instructions

Common issues and fixes:

1. Build fails:
```bash
# Clear cache and node_modules
rm -rf .next
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

2. Image loading issues:
- Make sure images are in the domains list in next.config.js
- Use relative paths for local images

3. API routes not working:
- Make sure to use proper Netlify functions format
- Add proper redirects in netlify.toml

Would you like me to:
1. Create a deployment script?
2. Show how to handle environment variables?
3. Add more configuration options?

Let me know if you need help with any specific part of the deployment process!
